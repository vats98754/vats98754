Hi, I’m @vats98754 (Anvay Vats)
I’m interested in math and computer science (and data science).
I’m currently learning competitive programming, deep learning, web design/development, and university-level mathematics.
I’m looking to collaborate on competitive programming (C++) or deep learning projects (with Pytorch/others).
